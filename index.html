                <p class="rd-rule">Please do not take yourself so seriously, life is too short.  If you can't play then go somewhere else.  America needs your business.</p>
                <p class="rd-rule">Please do not block the sidewalk (our neighbors, seniors, wheel chairs and dog owners come first) - so please stand in line and be patient.</p>
                <p class="rd-rule">No pushy, entitled and alpha spoilt "mama's boys" or angry barbie/cheerleader wannabe girls.  They scare me and I shut down my gushing love fountain.  Remember, if I can't love you - I can't feed you.</p>
                <p class="rd-rule">No "ice water with lemon" and no "just hot water"  It is cheap, suburban and annoying.</p>
                <p class="rd-rule">No egg-white orders.  If you alter our menu, you will be spanked and sent home to cook for yourself.</p>
                <p class="rd-rule">If you give off bad energy vibes while waiting because quote: "I am a paying customer" and you expect the world to bend over for you, I will ask you to leave.</p>
